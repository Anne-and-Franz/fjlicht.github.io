			<h1>About</h1>
      <pre>I have studied a mix of biology, ecology, computational biology, and plant pathology.<br> 
	      
	      An alumnus of Pennsylvania State University, I have worked in numerous research fields, from mycorrhizal fungi with Dr. Roger Koide, to human pathology at <a href=http://www.wrair.army.mil>the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research</a>.<br>
	      
	      
	      I now work on agricultural plant pathogens, particularily fungal pathogens of potato.<br> 
	      
	      
	      I began my graduate studies at the University of New Hampshire in Plant Biology, before moving with the Broders lab to CSU.<br> 
	      
	      
	      I have traveled to Senegal in Western Africa for a National Science Foundation fellowship to study soil microbial ecology.<br> And now live in Fort Collins, Colorado.<br> 
	      
	      
	      With my personal time I get outside, work on my current research interests and recreational activities.</pre>
